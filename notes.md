After starting my CLi gem with a command line message of 'bin/nelson_art' the program calls a  CLI controller which contains:

	-welcome statement and two other choices:
		-the Nelson's weekly schedule(it's a little unusual, open Sat. and Sun. and  closed a couple of days during the week, plus hours of operation)
		-menu of exhibit choices. after going to the exhibit choices, you are   presented with a number list of about 20 names of exhibits that are showing  at the Nelson now or in the near future.

	-select a number and you will be presented with the following exhibit information:
		-name
		-dates
		-thumbnail explanation of the exhibit
		-cost (most are free, but some do cost and require a ticket)
		-location within the Nelson Art Gallery

	-you will be asked if you want to make another selection or exit the program. If you want to make another selection, the exhibit menu will popup again. If you want to exit a friendly goodbye message will popup and then the program ends.
